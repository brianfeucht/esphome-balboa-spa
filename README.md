## Component for Balboa Spa

This project is based on the UART reader from [Dakoriki/ESPHome-Balboa-Spa](https://github.com/Dakoriki/ESPHome-Balboa-Spa)

There are a ton of these implementations on Github.  None of the ones I could find implemented the external component pattern as prescribed by EspHome.  So I create this one.  

Climate, binary sensors, sensors, and switches are all optional.  So you only need to import what you want with your implementation.

TODO:
I am seeing a ton of CRC errors when reading data on my spa.  This might be invalid UART config (baud, buffer, etc). Or it might just be due to the noisy nature of running next two heaters and pumps.
